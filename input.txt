Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the moneythat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got sixthousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money whenit was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out atinterest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas she tookme for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was roughliving in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular anddecent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it nolonger I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again,and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said hewas going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go backto the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and shecalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweatand sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing commencedagain.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time.When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had towait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over thevictuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them,--thatis, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a barrel of oddsand ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind ofswaps around, and the things go better.
